## Overview
Simple Matlab scripts on AM FM synthesis(1), FIR Signal/Image Filtering and Restoration(2), Encoding & Decoding Touch-Tone (DTMF) Signals(3).
These served as an important preliminary backbone into getting accquainted with Digital Signal Processing(DSP) with Matlab.
This work was part of an EE112 Course and included the collaborative efforts of Rishi Sheth, Raivat Nandekar, and Aryan Jadhav.
